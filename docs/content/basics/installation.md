# Installation
Before installing probatio and its tools it is recommended to delete older version before.
```bash
sudo snap remove probatio probatioed
```
To install probatio and all its tools you need to execute the following command below.
```bash
sudo snap install probatio probatioed
```
It is recommended to always install the latest version of probatio. But you can install 
from the edge and beta branch as well.

Furthermore, there will be a new release each week around 7PM SET on the stable branch.
This makes it possible to update regular and keep the software up to date.
